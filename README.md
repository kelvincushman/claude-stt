## Install

Inside a Claude Code instance, run the following commands:

**Step 1: Add the marketplace**
```
/plugin marketplace add jarrodwatts/claude-stt
```

**Step 2: Install the plugin**
```
/plugin install claude-stt
```

**Step 3: Run setup**
```
/claude-stt:setup
```

Done! Hold **Ctrl+Shift+Space** to record, release to transcribe.

> **Note**: First run downloads the Moonshine model (~200MB). Requires microphone permissions.

## What is Claude STT?

Claude STT gives you voice input directly into Claude Code. No typing required — just speak naturally.

| What You Get | Why It Matters |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Local processing** | All audio processed on-device using Moonshine STT |
| **Low latency** | ~400ms transcription time |
| **Push-to-talk** | Hold hotkey to record, release to transcribe |
| **Cross-platform** | macOS, Linux, Windows |
| **Privacy first** | No audio or text sent to external services |

### How It Works

```
Hold Ctrl+Shift+Space
        ↓
Audio captured from microphone
        ↓
Moonshine STT processes locally (~400ms)
        ↓
Text inserted into Claude Code input
        ↓
Release hotkey → done
```

**Key details:**
- Audio is processed in memory and immediately discarded
- Uses Moonshine ONNX for fast local inference
- Keyboard injection or clipboard fallback
- Native system sounds for audio feedback

## Configuration

Customize your settings anytime:

```
/claude-stt:config
```

### Options

| Option | Values | Default | Description |
|--------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `hotkey` | Key combo | `ctrl+shift+space` | Trigger recording |
| `mode` | `push-to-talk`, `toggle` | `push-to-talk` | Hold vs press to toggle |
| `engine` | `moonshine`, `whisper` | `moonshine` | STT engine |
| `moonshine_model` | `moonshine/tiny`, `moonshine/base` | `moonshine/base` | Model size |
| `output_mode` | `auto`, `injection`, `clipboard` | `auto` | How text is inserted |
| `sound_effects` | `true`, `false` | `true` | Play audio feedback |
| `max_recording_seconds` | 1-600 | 300 | Maximum recording duration |

Settings stored in `~/.claude/plugins/claude-stt/config.toml`.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.10-3.13** (via uv)
- **~200MB disk space** for STT model
- **Microphone access**

### Platform-Specific

| Platform | Additional Requirements |
|----------|------------------------|
| **macOS** | Accessibility permissions (System Settings > Privacy & Security) |
| **Linux** | xdotool for window management; X11 recommended (Wayland has limitations) |
| **Windows** | pywin32 for window tracking |

---

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/claude-stt:setup` | First-time setup: check environment, install deps, download model |
| `/claude-stt:start` | Start the STT daemon |
| `/claude-stt:stop` | Stop the STT daemon |
| `/claude-stt:config` | Change settings |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| No audio input | Check microphone permissions in system settings |
| Keyboard injection not working | **macOS**: Grant Accessibility permissions. **Linux**: Ensure xdotool installed |
| Model not loading | Run `/claude-stt:setup` to download. Check disk space (~200MB) |
| Hotkey not triggering | Check for conflicts with other apps. Try `/claude-stt:config` to change hotkey |
| Text going to wrong window | Plugin tracks original window — ensure Claude Code was focused when recording started |

---

## Privacy

**All processing is local:**
- Audio captured from your microphone is processed entirely on-device
- Moonshine runs locally — no cloud API calls
- Audio is never sent anywhere, never stored (processed in memory, discarded)
- Transcribed text only goes to Claude Code input or clipboard

**No telemetry or analytics.**
